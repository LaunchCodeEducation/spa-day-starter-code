# spa-day-starter-code

After all of the hard work we have put into learning about Thymeleaf, it is time for a spa day! First, we need to put our knowledge of Thymeleaf to the test. Instead of heading out to our favorite spa, let’s make an application for the owners!

Our application needs to do the following:

Display the user’s name and skin type under their customer profile.
Display the appropriate facial treatments for their skin type.
Display the description of the spa’s manicures or pedicures depending on the user’s interest.
As always, read through the whole page before starting to code.
